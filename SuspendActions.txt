Action Struct field 16 (byte) is used to know what to do after loading a suspend:
    0 is player phase
    1 is player phase before action (which is also used before traps and is thus the cause of the enemy control glitch)
    2 is computer phase
    3 is berserk phase
    4 is during arena fight
    9 is during phase switch
