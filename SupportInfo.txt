This is probably known stuff but I don't have internet to check rn.

Func at 0808371C: void StartSupportTalk(s8 charA, s8 charB, int level);
Func at 08084748 gets SupportTalkInfo addr given character pair as args
Func at 0808478C gets support song id given character pair and level as args

SupportTalkInfo table at 089ED10C

SupportTalkInfo:
	+00       | short    | char id A
	+02       | short    | char id B
	+04       | short[3] | convo text ids
	+0C+00bit | 5bit     | C convo song id(*)
	+0C+05bit | 5bit     | B convo song id(*)
	+0C+10bit | 5bit     | A convo song id(*)

(*): song ids are not actual song ids! see func at 0808478C
	id 1 => song 0x27
	id 2 => song 0x4C
	id 3 => song 0x6A
	id 4 => song 0x6A
	anything else => no song change (bgm gets quieter instead)
