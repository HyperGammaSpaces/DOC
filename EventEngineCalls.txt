CheckForEvents (FE8U:08082EC4):
	Arguments: r0 = Initial Event Check Buffer
	Returns: r0 = Event Check Buffer Pointer for first callable event (0 if none)

CallEventsFromBuffer (FE8U:08082E80):
	Arguments: r0 = Event Check Buffer, r1 = Passed Argument to Event Engine Call
	Returns: nothing
	
	Will call the events corresponding the output of CheckForEvents

Event Check Buffer Struct: (pointer passed to event check routines, usually allocated on the stack)
	00 | word | pointer to current event definition (in ROM usually)
	04 | word | zeroed at the start of checks, outputs event code pointer
	08 | word | zeroed at the start of checks, outputs event id to set
	0C | word | outputs command Id?
	10 | 
	14 | 
	18 | byte | input unit x position
	19 | byte | input unit y position

Event Check Table Entry:
	00 | word | pointer to check routine (Call info: Argument r0 = Event Check Buffer, routine is intended to fill buffer upon success)
	04 | word | size in words of the event code
