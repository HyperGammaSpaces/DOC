0203E788 is a Vec2: it holds the tile-coordinates of the origin of all help box positions. It is typically (0, 0) for boxes at fixed positions, but somethings (such as the battle preview) require help box positions to have variable origin.

080892D0 returns a number identifying the kind of help box based on the item it gets:
    0 for regular items or monster weapons (no additional stuff)
    1 for weapons
    2 for staves
    3 for non-items (item 0xFFFE/(-2) was given as argument) (displays "Base" & "LV", so it must have special meaning) (That's for the save screen help text rite?)
