I'll use the term SMS for Standing Map Sprite

There's a bunch of systems overlapping each others here, but the core thing is pretty straightforward:
at 02033F40 is an array of 0xD0 bytes indexed by SMS Index. It's either 0xFF or the "Tile Index" of the Obj graphics in the buffer

at 02034010 begins an array of 3 0x2000 (!) bytes long buffers for the SMS tile sheet, one for each frame.
