FE8U DEBUG REMNANTS NOTES

Routines related to debug seem to be located around 0x01C000

0801C090 is the Debug Startup routine, the following EA code will replace the standard one with it:
	ORG 0x000AD8
		BL(0x01C090)
Seems to work 100% well

0859D040: Map Debug Menu Def
0801BB1C calls that, but seems to also be a menu effect routine (takes Menu 6C as r0, returns 1 etc)
08033468 calls that, but seems to be for prep screen?

This replaces the guide menu command with the map debug menu:
	ORG 0x59CEC0
		POIN (0x04F448+1) // always usable
		WORD 0            // no fancy drawing
		POIN (0x01BB1C+1) // calls the map debug menu

will not work in no$ because of the following:
	6C at 0859AA5C (blank, deletes itself immediately) seems to be looked for by a bunch of debug routines, so I think it's safe to assume this used to be some "debug manager", but now is removed.

Known 6C 0859AA5C Fields:
	58 | word  | weather id (0 => 0, 1 => 6, 2 => 1, 3 => 2, 4 => 4, 5 => 3, 6 => 5)
	64 | short | Display DBG Boolean
	66 | short | Display Debug Info Boolean

ONE DAY LATER, I have the prototype version on hand (thank lin again) (I will refer the prototype rom as FE8P and the standard game as FE8U):

First main difference: optimization level of asm is way lower (to be expected).

The missing 6C is called "DEBMON", and does a bunch of stuff

it is constructed in 6C thread 3 at FE8P:08042E06 (equivalent to FE8U:0803102A, but nothing there)
Same for somewhere in FE8U:08030E04 (Chapter Setup) (FE8P:08042B6C)

FE8P:08015CB4 (Routine that makes the phase controller 6Cs) is quite different from its conterpart FE8U:08015450: It possesses checks to make the different phases player controlled or just plain skipped.

TWO DAYS LATER, I found stuff related to the debug print screen and such in the standard FE8U rom

I'll refer as DBG the debug text buffer that is basically where is printed all of the debug text (in raw ascii)
It's 0x2000 bytes (!) long, and there's 0x20 bytes used per line. for a total of 0x100 lines possible

0800378C | Loads Debug Font (BG)    | Arguments: r0 = BG Index (2), r1 = Tile Offset (0 for default)
08003804 | Displays String to BG    | Arguments: r0 = Output Tile Root, r1 = String pointer
0800394C | Prints Dec Number to DBG | Arguments: r0 = Number, r1 = Digit count to display
080039B4 | Prints Hex Number to DBG | Arguments: r0 = Number, r1 = Digit count to display
080039D0 | Prints String to DBG     | Arguments: r0 = String pointer (will understand newlines!)
08003A3C | Displays DBG text on BG2 | Arguments: none
08003ABC | Displaus DBG text on BG2 and handles V-Scroll | Arguments: r0 = current key presses, r1 = new key presses

08003B24 | Loads Debug Font (OBJ)   | Arguments: r0 = OBJ Tile Offset (negative => default), r1 = OBJ Palette Index
08003BB0 | Prints String as OBJ     | Arguments: r0 = x, r1 = y, r2 = String pointer
08003BFC | Prints Dec Number as OBJ | Arguments: r0 = x, r1 = y, r2 = Number, r3 = Digit count to display
08003C20 | Prints Hex Number as OBJ | Arguments: r0 = x, r1 = y, r2 = Number, r3 = Digit count to display
08003C44 | Another Print idk        | idk

ACTUAL FINDING IN THE PROTOTYPE VERSION: Pressing B + R + Left (with Left being the last press) will bring up the debug console output (aka display DBG).
^ This is managed by DEBMON
