FE8U

Some related Proc (Item Got Manager):
    54 | word | unit
    58 | word | item

Popup Proc: (use for general battle map stuff, including map battle animations)
    2C | word  | pointer to "popup definition"
    30 | word  | timer (when reaches 0, closes popup, if negative, waits for button press)
    34 | byte  | tile X
    35 | byte  | tile Y
    36 | byte  | popup window style?
    37 | byte  | tile X again
    38 | byte  | tile Y again
    39 | byte  | tile width
    3A | byte  | tile height (3?)
    3B | byte  | text color
    3E | short | icon id?
    40 | short | icon obj tile index
    42 | byte  | icon palette id (out)
    44 | byte  | icon x?
    46 | short | gfx len?
    48 | short | Sound Id to Play
    
    NOTE: in my rework, I use 4C+ for other stuff:
        4C | word | Icon Adder (Args: r0 = Popup Proc, r1 = Icon short, r2 = local x)
        50 | word | Icon Updater Proc

Popup Proc OAM Updater (for Icon Obj):
    2C | word  | x
    30 | word  | y
    4A | short | OAM2
    NOTE: I redo this completely in my rework

"popup definitions":
    It's just a list of "Components". One component is 8 byte long and is composed of one "Code" and one "Argument" (each of those is a word)
    
    Popup Component Codes:
        00 | END
        01 | SPACE; Argument = Size in pixels
        02 | RAW ITEM NAME
        03 | "Some " + Item Name (well, depends on item)
        04 | "some " + Item Name (same)
        05 | String of character name
        06 | String; Argument: Text ID
        07 | String; Argument: String Pointer
        08 | Change color; Argument: Color ID
        09 | Icon (Item)
        0A | Icon (Weapon Type)
        0B | Number String
        0C | Sets sound to play; Argument: Sound ID

    Relevant RAM offsets:
        030005F0: pointer to relevant Unit Struct
        030005F4: item short / weapon type index
        030005F8: number word

BATTLE ANIMS ON POPUP (because those are different for some reason (Actually the reason is probably because the BG/Obj layout during battle is different))

02020140 is where Popup Proc pointers seem to be stored

ekrPopup: (Anims On Popup)
    2C | short | Counter (incremented by 1 each frame a popup is up)
    2E | short | Counter End Value
    44 | word  | W-Rank up Item Short
    48 | word  | Weapon broke Item Short
    4C | word  | W-Rank up Item Short (2)
    50 | word  | Weapon broke Item Short (2)
    60 | word  | AIS

ekrPopup2:
    44 | word | W-Rank up Weapon type?
    48 | word | Same???????
