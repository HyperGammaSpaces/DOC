World Map 6C:
	3E | byte | Current WM Location Id?
	44 | word | Gmap Screen
	4C | word | Gmap Unit (Container)
	50 | word | Gmap Cursor
	54 | word | Gmap MU

GmapScreen:
	29 | byte  | some bitfield

	2B | byte  | (0 initially)
	2C | byte  | (0 initially)
	2D | byte  | (0 initially)
	2E | byte  | (0 initially)
	2F | byte  | (0 initially)
	30 | byte  | (0 initially)
	31 | byte  | (0 initially)
	32 | byte  | (0 initially)
	33 unused?
	34 | short | (0 initially)
	36 | short | (0 initially)
	38 | short | (0 initially)
	3A | short | (0 initially)
	3C | word  | some pointer to ROM (8A83364 initially)
	40 | word  | pointer to BG Tilemap buffer
	44 | word  | pointer to some decompressed data (from 8A96064 initially)
	4C | word  | GmapRoute 6C pointer

GMapScreenVSync:
	2C | word  | GmapScreen.3C
	30 | word  | GmapScreen.40
	

GmapRoute:
	2C | word  | 0x5000
	32 | byte  | bitfield?
	34 | byte  | 
	35 | byte  | transition effect bg index
	3C | short | timing denominator factor?
	3E | short | timing numerator factor?
	40 | word  | pointer to 03005324 (displayed route id list thing)

Gmap MU 6C:
	2C | Array of 7 Words | Gmap MU prim

Gmap MU prim 6C:
	29 | byte  | idk ()
	2A | byte  | Gmap MU prim index in the Gmap MU (<0 when unused)
	2B | byte  | index of the linked Gmap Unit ((-1) at start)
	2C | byte  | idk (0 initially)
	40 | short | idk (0 initially)
	

At 03005290 (03005280+0x10) seems to be an array of struct { byte; byte; short; } that's strongly tied to Gmap MUs (It's indexed the same way)
	00 | byte  | some bitfield (&1 = set when linked Gmap MU prim is used?, &2 = Use class (char otherwise))
	01 | byte  | Current WM Location Index?
	02 | short | Char/Class ID

GmapUnit (container) 6C (6C Code at: 08A3DEFC):
	2C | word    | something
	34 | 7 words | pointers to GmapUnit 6C, all deleted when this one is deleted

GmapUnit 6C (6C Code at: 08A3DECC):
	2A | short | bitfield (0 initially, &4 = ?)
	2C | short | 8 initially (TCS "OAM index")
	2E | short | 0x100 initially
	30 | word  | same as container:2C (base tile index for SMS gfx?)
	34 | byte  | index within container
	35 | byte  | Allegience color index
	36 | byte  | Palette index
	37 | byte  | current TCS anim id (4 initially)
	38 | short | class initially
	3A | short | class initially

	40 | word  | pointer to a *The Confusing Struct*

WORD MAP EVENT CODES:
	80
	81
	82
	83
	84 | Sets camera position on a WM location?
	85 | Same as 84, but given on a sprite's WM location
