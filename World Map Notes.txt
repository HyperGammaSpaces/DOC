Gmap MU Proc:
    2C | Array of 7 Gmap MU prim proc pointers

Gmap MU prim Proc:
    29 | byte  | idk ()
    2A | byte  | Gmap MU prim index in the Gmap MU (<0 when unused)
    2B | byte  | index of the linked Gmap Unit ((-1) at start)
    2C | byte  | idk (0 initially)
    40 | short | idk (0 initially)
    

At 03005290 (03005280+$10) seems to be an array of struct { byte; byte; short; } that's strongly tied to Gmap MUs (It's indexed the same way)
    00 | byte  | some bitfield (&1 = set when linked Gmap MU prim is used?, &2 = Use class (char otherwise))
    01 | byte  | Current WM Location Index?
    02 | short | Char/Class ID

    2C | word    | something
    34 | 7 words | pointers to GmapUnit 6C, all deleted when this one is deleted

GmapUnit Proc (Scr at: 08A3DECC):
    2A | short | bitfield (0 initially, &4 = ?)
    2C | short | 8 initially (AP obj priority node)
    2E | short | 0x100 initially
    30 | word  | same as container:2C (base tile index for SMS gfx?)
