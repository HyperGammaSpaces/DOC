Battle Anim Round Types:
    0 Hit 2 (Close)
    1 Crit 2 (Close)
    2 Non-Crit 2 (Far)
    3 Crit 2 (Far)
    4 Miss (Close) (Also promotion)
    5 Miss (Far)
    6 Hit (Close)
    7 Standing (never set to the round type array itself, only exists indirectly through a hardcoded reference to the lookup described below)
    8 Hit (Far)
    9 Miss 2 (Close)

at FE8U:080DAEF0, there is a lookup table that maps one of the indices above to the following struct:
    +00 | byte | Front layer frame index
    +01 | byte | Front layer AIS draw depth (higher values means in front, so typically hight value than [+03])
    +02 | byte | Back layer frame index
    +03 | byte | Back layer AIS draw depth (^, so typically lower value than [+01])

The frame indices follow the "modes" that battle anim scripters are familiar with (with everything shifted down one, some mode 1 corresponds to index 0)
