All offsets and routines are for FE8U

The range display displays squares:
	from the move map:  if the tile is >=0 (? might want further investigation)
	from the range map: if the tile is non 0

Range Display Type bitfield:
	 &0x01 | Move  Squares are Blue
	 &0x02 | Range Squares are Red
	 &0x04 | Range Squares are Green
	 &0x10 | Range Squares are Blue

/!\ if you don't specify Range square color, you'll want the range map to be empty, otherwise you'll get rainbow tiles (tm). (May apply to move tiles too?)
